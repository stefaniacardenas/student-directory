#Student Directory
==================

This is my first project at Makers Academy. The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the March cohort 2014 at Makers Academy.


If you are interested in Makers Academy please visit [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/â€Ž)

Features
--------

The student directory will have the following features:

* Show the list of all students
	- ordered by name
	- grouped by cohort (as an exercise)
* Add new students by asking the user to input the names
* Show information about a given student
* Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
* Interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do
* Displaying aggregate info (statistics)
* Saving this data to a file
* Loading it from the file

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use.

How to use
-----------

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
